Dijkstra’s Algorithm in C++

Overview
This project implements **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** in C++ to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.  
The program takes a starting node and an ending node as input and outputs:
The shortest distance (cost) between them  
The exact path taken  

This assignment is part of Concordia University coursework.


Features
- Uses a priority queue (min-heap) for efficiency  
- Supports weighted graphs with non-negative edges
- Reconstructs and displays the shortest path
